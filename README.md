# Momento Shared Github Actions

In the [./github-actions](./github-actions) directory, you will find source code for a few
github actions that we re-use across multiple other repos. The most interesting ones are the
README generator actions.

There is no automation around the release process for these actions. Please see the README
in the github-actions dir for more info.
