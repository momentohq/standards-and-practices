# Momento on GitHub: OSS Project Status and Stability

Hi!  If you're reading this page, you probably clicked on one of the badges on one of our open source projects.
Welcome!

On this page we have some info for you on how we categorize our open source projects.  All of our projects
have a "Project Status" and a "Project Stability", which will give you a bit more insight into how well-supported
the projects are.

If you did not get here by clicking on one of the badges, feel free to
[go click on one now](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript)!
It's fun!  We'll see you back here in a few seconds.

Each project has badges at the top of its README that let you know what its Status and Stability are.

## Project Status

Project Status gives you insight into what level of support Momento provides for a project.
Here is a list of the different Project Statuses that our open source projects may be assigned:

| Status                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![official](./badges/project-status-official.svg)   | Fully supported projects, such as our official SDKs.  Any bugs, performance issues, or user experience issues in these projects are of utmost importance to us and we will strive to address them as quickly as possible.                                                                                            |
| ![incubating](./badges/project-status-incubating.svg) | These projects are considered experimental, not mature enough, or lacking in release quality such as testing or supporting documentation. They are provided as-is. You're welcome to use them.  Projects that garner a lot of community interest will be considered for promotion to 'official' status. |

## Project Stability

| Stability                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![experimental](./badges/project-stability-experimental.svg) | Experimental means "try it only in toy projects".  We are just trying out an idea and want some users to play with it and give feedback. If it doesn't work out, we may not continue to maintain it.                                                                                                                                    |
| ![alpha](./badges/project-stability-alpha.svg)        | Alpha means "you may experience migration issues as we make backward incompatible changes." We have decided to productize this project, but it hasn't reached its final shape yet.  We are always happy to help you work through any migration issues so do not hesitate to reach out!                                         |
| ![beta](./badges/project-stability-beta.svg)         | Beta means "you can use it, we'll do our best to minimize migration issues for you": It’s almost done, user feedback is especially important now. Still, it's not 100% finished, so changes are possible (including ones based on your own feedback). Watch for deprecation warnings in advance for the best update experience. |
| ![stable](./badges/project-stability-stable.svg)       | Stable means "use it even in most conservative scenarios": It’s done. We will be evolving it according to our strict backward compatibility rules.                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Repo Topics
Github has the ability to add [topics](https://github.com/topics) to github repos to help with discoverability. We should be try to standardize the topics we have on each repo. This table is meant to be the source of truth for mandatory topics we want added on our repos

|Topic|RepoType|CurrentRepos|
|---|---|---|
|`sdk`|Any Client SDK Repos|[Link](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Asdk+org%3Amomentohq+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)|
